# Code-Quiz

## Description

The goal was to build a timed coding quiz from scratch. Once the user clicks the start button, they will have 75 seconds (15 seconds per question) to answer all five questions. Once all five questions are answered, they will be given a score based on how well they did. That score will be saved and displayed in a list.
